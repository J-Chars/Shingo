Upon grabbing successfully, Shingo will hit the opponent a few times, then you will
be prompted to mash the punch buttons repeatedly. The amount of times you mash punch
will dictate how good the Level 3 super will be.
If you mash too much, then Shingo will fail this super, same with if you mash too
little. Get it just right and you'll get the full 50% damage.

-Properties-
=MAX Super

=== CRITICAL HITS ===

Critical Hits are a unique feature only used with Shingo.
They are much stronger hits from specials/supers that reward
you with many varying things: extra damage and juggling
opportunities among other things.

These are the conditions for critical hits:
- Opponent must have forward velocity
  = alternatively, you can hit it in a combo when hitting the move right outside the throw area
- You have to hit the special/super in a specific window
  = Some are unique while others are not
- Criticals can only be obtained from specials and supers
  = EX specials and level 2/3 supers cannot get critical hits
